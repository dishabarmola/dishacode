        Long ago, a king and queen had a baby daughter named Rapunzel with golden hair contained magical healing powers. A selfish old woman named Gothel kidnapped the baby and raised her in a tower somewhere hidden.

        Meanwhile, a young thief named Flynn Rider had stolen something special from the King’s castle, and the guards were after him. Suddenly, he saw the perfect hiding place — a tower and he climbed to it.
        
        Rapunzel knocked him out with a frying pan. Then she secretly hide the satchel he carried. Flynn Rider awoke and found himself tied to a chair with Rapunzel’s golden hair.
        
        If Flynn took her to see the outside world, she’d return his satchel. Flynn agreed to help. Rapunzel and Flynn enjoyed their adventure, but they were being chased by Mother Gothel and the guards.
        
        Days passed, and Rapunzel and Flynn managed to escape them. In the town, Rapunzel realized that she is the lost princess. Later, Flynn and Rapunzel were separated. Mother Gothel captured Rapunzel.
        
        Suddenly, Flynn arrived to rescue Rapunzel! But Mother Gothel hurt him badly. But before Rapunzel could act, Flynn cut off her hair, which lost its magic. Without the magic, Mother Gothel quickly aged and turned to dust. Rapunzel was now free, but Flynn was dying.
        
        One of Rapunzel’s tears fell on Flynn and began to glow… and healed him! Flynn brought Rapunzel back to the castle. The King and Queen rushed to embrace their lost princess.
        
        That night, the entire kingdom celebrated her return.</pre>
